I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Information Science of Beijing Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. Tangwen Yang and Prof. Qiuqi Ruan.
Before that, I received my masterâ€™s degree from Shenzhen University, advised by Prof. Weixin Xie. My research interest lies at the intersection
of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on crowd counting, crowd behavior analysis, semi-supervised learning,
and continual domain adaptation.
