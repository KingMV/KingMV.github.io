I am Xin Wang (王鑫 in Chinese), I received my doctoral degree from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://iis.bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Tangwen Yang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7995/) and Prof. [Qiuqi Ruan](http://iis.bjtu.edu.cn/KyryInfo.aspx?m=20150107094205590028&n=20150107131848403132).
Before that, I received my master’s degree from Shenzhen University, advised by Prof. [Weixin Xie](https://it.szu.edu.cn/gfkjzdsys/info/1012/1013.htm). My research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. In particular, my work focuses on multimodal large language model, embodied intelligence,  crowd behavior analysis, self/semi-supervised learning, and continual domain adaptation.


<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>

Currently, my research mainly centers on 

* **Multimodal large language model**: Vision-Language large model, Efficient fine-tuning, Model data leakage.
* **Crowd behavior analysis**: Crowd counting and localization, abnormal behavior detection.
* **Data-efficient learning**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL), Few-shot learning.
* **Continual learning**: Continual unsupervised domain adaptation(CUDA), Test-time adaptation(TTA).
